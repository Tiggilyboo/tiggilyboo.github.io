      <description>Easy HTTPS It has always frustrated me that even the largest companies like Microsoft have had HTTPS certificate renewal issues. With the invention of technologies like Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt people can finally not have to pay a fortune for certificates, and renew using its API. To make this process even easier, there are web server&amp;rsquo;s like Caddy that implement this for you. There is no excuse anymore, just do HTTPS from the start.</description>
