      <description>Intro Great it&amp;rsquo;s been 3 months, where the heck is my finished keyboard? Let&amp;rsquo;s get up to speed - I am curently typing this article with the new keyboard, without a case and a wonky ESC switch, but lets start at the beginning, from finishing Part 2:&#xA;We had a &amp;ldquo;working&amp;rdquo; interrupt firing and internal key events being issued to the SBC. We did not have external input mode via USB HID.</description>

      <description>Intro As a quick refresher from the first part in the series, I&amp;rsquo;m making a handwired keyboard which uses an altogether rediculous chinese knockoff 6 core monster SBC (The RK3399). Better yet, there are not enough GPIOs available on the board to handle the input matrix (12x4). Oh, and the case I want to use (from my current keyboard does not have enough vertical headroom to fit it, so I have to manually strip the taller components by hand so it has enough clearance.</description>

      <description>Idea So I&amp;rsquo;ve been typing on an ortholinear mechanical keyboard called the Planck for roughly 8 months, and have been thoroughly enjoying it. But I felt as though it could benefit from being a standalone linux board, offering wireless / bluetooth, HDMI, oh and a full linux distribution.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with the Odroid u3&amp;rsquo;s in the past, but only to set up a mpich cluster, beowolf or docker swarm cluster in university, but I never really got beyond the software side of things.</description>
